# odin-recipes
The first Odin project

## Description
This project is a simple way to demonstrate the ability to use HTML to create a website with a given structure on a given topic (namely, recipes).

The webpages make use of the following:
* various levels of headings
* links and images
* ordered and unordered lists

Aside from the aforementioned, the project is a good way to learn to use Emmet ext. tag wrapping in VS Code for list items.
