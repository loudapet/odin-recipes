    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Meatballs</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pounds lean ground pork</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon and ½ teaspoon fish sauce</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon lemon grass puree</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon peanut oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons peanut oil, divided</li>
        <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can Hunt's® Diced Tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons red curry paste</li>
        <li>¾ cup canned coconut milk</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Fresh chopped cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine pork, fish sauce, garlic, ginger, lemon grass paste, cilantro, and peanut oil in a mixing bowl. Mix well. Refrigerate at least 1 hour to blend flavors.</li>
        <li>Shape pork mixture into 1 1/4-inch meatballs. (Mixture should yield approximately 34 to 36 meatballs.)</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon peanut oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook meatballs in batches, giving the pan a shake occasionally. Turn meatballs until brown on all sides and cooked through, approximately 14 to 16 minutes. Remove meatballs to a bowl.</li>
        <li>In a large saucepan, heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat. Cook onion until translucent, 5 to 6 minutes. Add tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Stir in curry paste. Cover and simmer over low heat until sauce begins to reduce, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from heat and cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Process sauce with an immersion blender until smooth. Stir in coconut milk and adjust taste by adding additional salt if needed. Return meatballs to sauce and simmer for an additional 5 minutes, or until warmed through.</li>
        <li>Garnish with cilantro if desired.</li>
    </ol>
